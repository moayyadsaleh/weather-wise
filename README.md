This repository includes a web app that provides real-time weather updates. I utilized Node.js and Express.js to build the server that handles user requests and communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API. By making HTTPS requests, I retrieve weather data based on user input, whether it's a city name or zip code.

The server-side code, written in JavaScript sets up the web server, handles form submissions, and processes API responses. I made effective use of the Node.js ecosystem and various npm modules to enhance the functionality of the application.

On the client-side, I leveraged HTML, CSS (utilizing the Bootstrap framework) to create an intuitive user interface. By submitting the search form, users can easily obtain weather updates and receive a visually appealing display of weather information.

Technolgy uses: Node.js, Express.js, API integration, and client-side scripting, html, JavaScript and CSS.
